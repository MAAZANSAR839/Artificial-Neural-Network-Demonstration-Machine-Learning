I created a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) demonstration using Python and TensorFlow. This project illustrates the fundamental concepts of neural networks, including layers, activation functions, and training processes, providing a clear and accessible introduction to machine learning. Explore the basics of ANN through easy-to-understand visualizations and interactive elements.
